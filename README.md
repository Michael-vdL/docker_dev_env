# docker_dev_env

Simple repo to test/demonstrate a fullstack github repo compatible with Docker Development Environment.

/app was generated via yarn create vite, selecting React Typescript
/api was generated via yarn init, and following the GraphQL tutorial on setting up a GraphQL Express server.

Planning on adding a Graph DB to this as well.
